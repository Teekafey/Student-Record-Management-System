# Student-Record-Management-System
A simple Student Record System that allows users to manage student information using C programming.

## Instructions

1. Initial Setup:
   - Write a program that displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter their name. The program should greet the user by their name.

2. Data Storage:
   - Implement storage for student information, including name, roll number, and marks, using appropriate data types.

3. Input and Output:
   - Add a feature to input a student's marks and display whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold (e.g., marks above 40 are considered passing).
